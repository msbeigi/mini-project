34,">>34374910>>34375142>i feel like i'm forgetting something...ah. yes.keep in mind that (((you know who))) has done everything and anything in their power to distort, destroy, or hide our tradition. when i said to research Hindu, that might sound strange at first, but keep in mind that they refer to the original keepers of tradition as ""aryans"".when i said 'distort' earlier, you'll be able to see that the hindu religion has been... appropriated for a different race. but they did a far better job at preserving the original teachings than, say, Norse. (reading old Norse is like trying to figure out the bible from basically 9 pages, after a child has scribbled over them)personally, i like the video series on bitchute by white mage: https://www.bitchute.com/channel/hyperborean_research/depending on how serious you are and how much time you have, it's worth a look at all of his videos. the first few he made were inspiring AF. keep in mind i don't necessarily agree with EVERYTHING he says, no one man has all the truth, but he's a really good place to start. so keep in mind that all of our old traditions have been lost or distorted, but once you understand norse, greek, and hindu, you'll start to see them come together like puzzles.and trust that instinct of yours, like i quoted earlier. it's your best friend. i still feel like i'm forgetting something...",https://boards.4channel.org/x/

22,"Some of the many guns from the old Doom movie adaption. I don't remember it being particularly good, but the first person shooter scene is kind of neat, and the guns look cool enough. I think a good adaption of Doom is doable, inherently you need to take some liberties and divert or invent some things, it's just that the two adaptions which exist mostly did that wrong.The assault rifles for the movie were largely built on H&K G36 rifles, with various sci-fi embellishments. Many of them feature what appear to be some sort of grenade launcher, one which is fed from a magazine even, but I don't recall if any of them were ever fired. If you look at one of them, it appears to have some sort of protective cage over the pistolgrip (almost like a basket hilted sword?), not sure there was any rationale there besides aesthetics. The rifle in the third row I think was barely used in the movie at all, it was left over or something and mainly stayed in the background, and you also have a subgun (built on a H&K MP5K).A lot of the shells for these have showed up on auction sites over the years, not so easy to get the actual blank converted assault rifles, the armorers probably still have those, but the outer shell parts and either demilled G36 rifles, or airsoft ones, with these parts fitted. Then you have some of the stunt castings, made from rubber and ""biscuit foam,"" with metal wire armatures to make them retain their shape, and painted on the outside to match the firing guns, so that you can do stunts with the weapons and not risk that someone gets impaled or breaks some bone. Or when they don't need to shoot or be close to the camera, so the actors can carry less heavy props.The stunt castings appear the most common (they're cheap and flimsy, so you make a bunch of them), the subgun here is one of those, but you can find examples of the others.

34,"You have never and will never ""make"" money.Fiat money cannot be created or transferred when you trade shares, sell something, or work for a wage. Only banks and the mint make fiat money; everyone else simply transfers it from existing capital. This says nothing about the value of work or exchange, but rather the actual fiat face value in numbers. So all the ""rich"" people, such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Warren Buffett, never made a single cent; they only ever had money transferred to them from the preexisting money pool. The money pool only has money put into it by the mint or a bank (an approved deposit-taking institution or similar), and the latter, the bank or lever, injects 90% of the money. Shares that are not realized represent a sort of quasi-money where they are swapped with other shares at a notional value, but that is a different question. Money is fiat and is made by fractional reserve banking through loans and deposited into an account. This then makes it a tax on everyone through inflation. Also, the only way to pay off a loan is for someone to take out a loan later on, and that loan money must flow to you to be able to pay off your loan, and so on. It's essentially a pyramid scheme of loans. This is not necessarily bad, as it brings capital and labor together, but when it becomes disconnected from underlying value and fiat has pure capital allocation against underlying value, then you see everything shortages, and things that can capture price inflation, such as houses, go up in price forever over the long term. At some inflection point, the everything shortage may see food stuffs and everything else go up much more quickly, as people sitting in offices sending paper around to each other have limited overall efficiency gains and do not actually grow food. That marginal gain exhausts at some point.",https://boards.4channel.org/vip/

John Horhn, D-Jackson. “Well, help and don’t hurt. If you want to help, sit down and communicate with us.”The vote, which fell mostly along party lines, was 34 to 15 after three hours of debate. Every Democrat representing the city of Jackson voted against it after underscoring several times that they and their House counterparts from Jackson have not been at the table for the legislative process.Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, who chairs the Judiciary A Committee and defended the legislation on the floor, called it the “Jackson bill” and said the committee’s goal of redoing the bill was to make the city safe. That echoes what bill author Rep. Trey Lamar, R-Senatobia, has said about HB 1020’s intent. “That’s all we’ve been trying to do,” Wiggins said. Senators drastically amended the original House bill, removing controversial House provisions including a proposed separate court system within the city, an expanded Capitol Complex Improvement District and permanent appointed judges. The amended bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday would approve five state-funded judges who would be appointed by the Supreme Court chief justice to serve until December 2025. The Senate bill would also give existing Capitol Police department jurisdiction throughout the entire city of Jackson, and it would provide funding for positions in the Hinds County court system including legal assistants.",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

The claim has been contradicted by Dominion Voting Systems, one of the companies suing Lindell, who alleges the CEO has used his claims of electoral fraud to boost sales.But while Lindell claims to be hemorrhaging cash, the company continues to liberally distribute discount codes for its sponsorship program. An investigation by the progressive watchdog Media Matters found that MyPillow was helping fund at least 17 QAnon-affiliated shows and personalities by offering them a cut of sales made through their sales code.These personalities include Sidney Powell, an attorney who, alongside Lindell, spread conspiracy theories regarding Dominion and Smartmatic voting systems, and has also been named as a defendant in the defamation suits brought by the company.https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mypillow-ceo-says-company-going-024330318.htmlGo woke, go bro- Oh...",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

While the bills vary in wording, they would have the same impact: limiting voters’ power to override abortion restrictions that Republicans imposed, which took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v.

In addition, police also found diapers and dolls around his apartment, including a child-sized doll in his bed.Sutherland is alleged to have told police that he had no children, and no nieces or nephews. While the computer was seized by police in June of 2022, the forensic processing of it wasn't finished until January.Montgomery County police arrested Sutherland on six misdemeanor counts of possession of child pornography in early February. Last week, a judge ordered that he remain held without bond.

The guilty verdict marks the end of Householder’s long political career in which he twice held the speaker’s gavel. He’ll be in the Ohio history books as the only speaker expelled from the Legislature and then convicted in a federal corruption case. Householder and Borges, who neither showed any emotion when the verdict was read aloud, face up to 20 years in prison. After a seven-week trial, jurors deliberated just nine hours over two days.The case made it to federal court because of its sweeping scope: $61 million in bribe money paid by FirstEnergy Corp. via dark money groups to help Householder seize political power and in turn pass and defend a $1.3 billion bailout law known as House Bill 6. “This isn’t typical political activity, and they know it,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Megan Painter said during closing statements at the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse in Cincinnati. “Mr. Householder abused that (public) trust and Mr. Borges helped him do it.” After the verdict, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Parker said that the case shows that even powerful state leaders will be held accountable. ""You cannot sell the public trust. It is not for sale.""""This is a big win for all Ohioans,"" Parker said.

Borges said after the verdict that he did not regret that choice.""I don't believe I would have been telling the truth (by pleading),"" Borges said. Householder was never given such an offer. Prosecutors introduced nearly 900 exhibits into evidence and slogged through volumes of text messages, emails, bank records and more than demonstrated what the men knew and actions they took. Two key players, Former FirstEnergy Solutions lobbyist Juan Cespedes and Householder’s political adviser Jeff Longstreth, took plea deals and testified against them. A fifth defendant, lobbyist Neil Clark, died by suicide in March 2021 after his arrest. Prosecutors also played secretly recorded phone calls and meetings captured by the FBI. Clark came on their radar while investigating a separate corruption case. Later, undercover agents posing as real estate developers with an interest in sports betting hired Clark as their lobbyist. Clark led them to Householder. Investigators tapped Clark’s phone but did not do a wiretap on Householder or Borges’ phones. Another big break came when Tyler Fehrman called the FBI in 2019 to report that Borges offered him a bribe in exchange for insider intel on the referendum campaign.

Borges, 50, of Bexley in Franklin County, opted against taking the stand and did not present any defense witnesses. Instead, his legal team tried to draw jurors’ attention to times when Borges’ name didn’t appear in meetings, documents or plans. But in the end, the jury decided it wasn’t enough for reasonable doubt. >What's next?U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black will sentence Householder and Borges in the coming months.

Trump siding with Russia or Fox News playing cover for Trump and censoring the interview to protect Trump?https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-edits-out-donald-trump-saying-he-mightve-let-russia-take-over-parts-of-ukraineDonald Trump has long insisted that the Ukraine war would have never happened if he were still president, going so far as to blame the “rigged election” on Russia’s unprovoked invasion while claiming he had the magic words to stop the fighting “immediately.”During a radio interview with Fox News host (and longtime confidant) Sean Hannity on Monday, the twice-impeached ex-president finally revealed how he personally would have prevented the war. According to Trump, all he needed to do was let Russia “take over” parts of Ukraine.Saying that Russia was going for the “whole enchilada” with Joe Biden as president, Trump added that Russia “took over nothing” while he was in the White House because Russian President Vladimir Putin “understood” that “he would have never done it.”The former president then added: “That’s without even negotiating a deal. I could have negotiated. At worst, I could’ve made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could’ve worked a deal.”Later that evening, Hannity played excerpts of his “exclusive” interview with Trump on his primetime Fox News program, along with highlights of Trump’s bombastic speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Though Hannity aired the segment featuring the ex-president boasting that he could have stopped the war, he curiously omitted the portion where Trump revealed his plan.Instead, shortly after Trump says, “I could have negotiated,” the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that “China no longer respects the United States.”",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

And how many youth change their appearances with hormones or surgery only to later change their minds and detransition?Here’s a look at some of the issues involved.>WHAT IS TRANSGENDER MEDICAL TREATMENT?Guidelines call for thorough psychological assessments to confirm gender dysphoria — distress over gender identity that doesn’t match a person’s assigned sex — before starting any treatment.That treatment typically begins with puberty-blocking medication to temporarily pause sexual development. The idea is to give youngsters time to mature enough mentally and emotionally to make informed decisions about whether to pursue permanent treatment. Puberty blockers may be used for years and can increase risks for bone density loss, but that reverses when the drugs are stopped.Sex hormones — estrogen or testosterone — are offered next. Dutch research suggests that most gender-questioning youth on puberty blockers eventually choose to use these medications, which can produce permanent physical changes. So does transgender surgery, including breast removal or augmentation, which sometimes is offered during the mid-teen years but more typically not until age 18 or later. Comment too long.

That includes not only three-fourths of Democrats but also more than a third of Republicans.Overall, 39% say instead that the word reflects what has become the GOP political definition, ""to be overly politically correct and police others' words."" That's the view of 56% of Republicans.The findings raise questions about whether Republican campaign promises to ban policies at schools and workplaces they denounce as ""woke"" could boost a contender in the party's primaries but put them at odds with broader public opinion in the general election.Independents, by 51%-45%, say ""woke"" means being aware of social injustice, not being overly politically correct.“Most Americans understand that to be woke is to be tuned in to injustices around us,” said Cliff Young of Ipsos. ""But for a key segment of Republicans who make up the Trump-DeSantis base, 'woke' is a clear trigger for the worst of the politically correct, emerging multicultural majority.""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/08/gop-war-woke-most-americans-see-term-positive-ipsos-poll/11417394002/Florida politics don't play well nationally.",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

Fred Deutsch and other South Dakota legislators use deeply religious language that shows Christian nationalists are pushing restrictions on LGBTQ rights as part of what they believe is a holy war, reported Vice News.“Know that many have prayed and are praying for you this day,"" wrote Vernadette Broyles, a lawyer and president of the Georgia-based Children and Parental Rights Campaign in a 2020 email. ""Do not back down, nor should you be afraid. Know that the Lord is with you. The children of South Dakota belong to him. He is jealous over them. Let his jealousies be spoken forth in the House of Representatives of South Dakota today so that his children would be made safe. Know you are HIS representative today. Do not be afraid. Stand firm in what is right.""The emails were shared with Vice by Elisa Rae Shupe, a trans woman who had de-transitioned and become an anti-trans advocate before re-transitioning and renouncing her ties to Christianity.“I fell prey to the belief that if I did what they suggested that I would be cured of my gender dysphoria,"" Shupe said. ""I was encouraged to confess my sins, ask for forgiveness by Jesus, and turn my plight over to the Lord Jesus Christ. I was also asked to accept that my transgender status was a sexually motivated sin and to cure myself by attending a religious 12-step program, which I did for approximately a year.""The messages are peppered with references to blessings, prayers and apocalyptic warfare.",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

Students at the school, New Brunswick High, said they feared that the woman, Hyejeong Shin, had malicious, possibly criminal, intentions after she tried to set up meetings with them at a location outside of school.>But on Monday, two lawyers hired by her family laid out a far less sinister explanation for the odd behavior: Recently divorced and far away from her family in South Korea, she was trying to recreate the sense of safety she had felt as a student at a Massachusetts boarding school.>""It's very bizarre,"" Darren M.

The audience is made aware of the crossdressing either with dialogue alone or with very half hearted attempts at masculine portrayal.>the reverse trap succeeds in passing. Those who know their agab are unnerved by their percieved deception, amazed by the novelty of it, or saddened in a ""such a waste"" sort of way. This is by no means a hard rule, just me shooting spitballs.

18,">>4158298It's amazing how much Fuji--despite nobody around here being all that vocal in terms of proactively shilling it compared to Pentax, Snoy, m43, or ugly obsolete boomer DSLRs from anticonsumer Canon--seems to inspire delirious rage from some users. They'll straight up make shit up or parrot information that is like 5 years behind to try and justify their preconceptions, all because at some point they internalized some meme that exclusively ""hipsters"" (who for some reason are then also taken to only be unskilled or casual) use Fuji and this delusion caused them personal outrage for some reason. It's especially funny since on top of there not being any real loud mouthed Fuji shills (just a handful of people who reasonably respond to the baseless malding), Fuji threads consistently get more actual original photo posts than any other brandfag thread.FDS was an apt term for what the geartranny haters experience seemingly all the time.",https://boards.4channel.org/p/

Primitively canned and jarred food that would leach metals or simply spoil. Plus refrigeration was yet to take off, so everything had to be kept cold on ice, making it significantly more expensive. All your standard vegetables and fruits were less available, and excluding the tomato, of lower quality. Apples back then were prone to russetting, stored poorly, and simply didnt taste as good. Sweet corn didnt even exist. On top of that, there was a health fad that really took root in Anglo and American culture at the time. Many people believed that heavily seasoned food was bad for you, and that the more something was cooked the healthier it was. The whole meme of white people not seasoning their food originates from that, and its why you see elderly people today refuse to season anything, and cook their mear until its leather.Yes, someone who literally lived on a farm and grew their own food might have a good diet relative to today, but the urban poor certainly didn't.",https://boards.4channel.org/ck/

Grotowski, author of ""Arms and Armour of the Warrior Saints: Tradition and Innovation in Byzantine Iconography (843-1261)"" (2010), to tuck the mace in one's belt was the ""Byzantine custom"" (p. 369).In the case of Georgian warriors, Mamuka Tsurtsumia, in his article ""The Mace in Medieval Georgia"", published in ""Acta Militaria Mediaevalia XIV"" (2018), states the following:>Most frequently, the Georgians would wear the mace ""inserted"" in the belt worn round their waists which is clearly attested in sources and artistic images. ""Amirandarejaniani"" informs us that the maces were put in the belt (Mose Khoneli 1967, 737); He attached the mace close to his waist (ibid., 774). In addition, ""Rusudaniani"" also mentions: The mace was put in the belt (Rusudaniani 1957, 56); The mace was worn close to the waist (ibid., 284); He put the mace through his belt (ibid., 286); He put the mace into his belt (ibid., 427). The same holds true for ""Shahnavaziani"": The mace is put through his belt (Peshangi 1935, 182) and ""Omainiani"": He took out the 12-flanged mace from the belt (Kaikhosro Cholokashvili 1979, 167).Here's a link to the full article: http://amm.sanok.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/04_Tsurtsumia_AMM_XIV.pdf",https://boards.4chan.org/ic/

He is the purported author of the Hermetica, a widely diverse series of ancient and medieval pseudepigraphical texts that lay the basis of various philosophical systems known as Hermeticism. [...]>During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the Hermetica enjoyed great prestige and were popular among alchemists. Hermes was also strongly associated with astrology, for example by the influential Islamic astrologer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi (787–886). The ""Hermetic tradition"" consequently refers to alchemy, magic, astrology, and related subjects. The texts are usually divided into two categories: the philosophical and the technical hermetica. The former deals mainly with philosophy, and the latter with practical magic, potions, and alchemy.",https://boards.4chan.org/ic/

67,"TLDR: What Italian authors should i name drop to impress an over educated student of 20'th century literature.Hey lit. Two years ago, Wanting to improve my Italian, i signed up for a language exchange app. I could already read well enough but had no pronunciation, and still have a hard time following conversations. (they just speak too fast) I got matched up with this girl and we agreed for me to teach her Russian in return. We were friendly enough that this summer im going to visit her for the first time. Dont imagine any kind of whirlwind romance but we get along well and i really want to impress her. I know everything about Russian literature, history and music. That shit was sometimes literally beaten into me by my parents, but despite reading a few history and art history books, Italian culture is foreign to me.I've read most the pic bellow as well as various popular literature but it all feels like entry level stuff. He mom is a big name academic, her dad is a first violin. She is, and may Lenin forgive me for my transgression, an over educated member of the bourgeoisie. She loves Arbasino, and brightened up when i mentioned reading Fratelli d'Italia. She also talked about Gadda, though i cant make heads or tails of the man. But thats it.

At all times humans are seeking a mutual understanding of ""blue"" to the finest point of accuracy. But why must we approach the same meanings? Why must eveyone's blue be the same? Why is this the human motive par excellence? Because the function of understanding is structured within the language itself, there becomes an implicit bias towards unification.

Some smell overly sweet and very faint, others like rose and pretty strong, others like faint sweet rose, others like syrup, i always triple check Toy Boy to see if it is not a flanker and no, they vary a lot so i can never say anything about it. Same with Terre D' Hermes, always somewhat different and i can never smell it that strong, straight from the bottle smells like a skin scent to me, guess i am a noselet for Iso E Super YET i supposedly have a bottle that uses that a whole lot and it smells like pure pencil but creamy.But i know very little of niche frags because i can buy a closet bottle with the money rather than a 5ml sample. Closet is what i refer to very popular frags that aren't on retail/physical stores for some obscure reason, most of the time classics like Drakkar Noir, Grey Flannel, Quorum, Pino Silvestre, Bogart and Lagerfeld stuff, they are hidden in storage in some weirdo stores and online salesmen.

42,">>940771>>940772I don't get your diagram. Where are the bones? What's moving?>>939852That's nice for the rotations you gave it. However, the arm and shoulder have much higher mobility range. The arms has to be capable of reaching down behind the back, and the rotating all way up and over behind the head. Which is a rotation of more than 180 degree. Possibly around 210. Granted, at the extreme extension, even the human body would appear stretched. But still, it has to rotate pretty far before losing volume or extreme clipping.Then add to, the shoulder joint has to be capable of twisting roughly 90 degrees. >>939858 (Cross-thread)Bendy Bones have a better time of creating smooth shoulder rotations. I've done a number of tests myself in that regard. The version I posted is like version 10 of bendy experiments. However, one bendy bone going through the shoulder and arm, creates something of noodle arm effect. The arm pit curves in an unconvincing way when the arm is down, and the bulk of the shoulder bends inward when the arms is up.I don't know. I think we both agree that weights are fundamentally flawed. But where we differ, is that I think whether or not you use automatic weights or fix the weights manually, it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

62,First of all i would add a lot more weight to the base. Then i would leave the square tube sticking up as the mounting point for multiple tops or accessories.

20,"Long ago, on a planet called Earth, the greatest martial artist of his time made the ultimate sacrifice to seal away the most fearsome tyrant the world had ever seen. Master Mutaito gave his life to put an end to the threat that the Demon King Piccolo posed to the world. Our story, however, begins before even that...>What is this?This is a story following the adventures of a youth on Earth from pre-dragonball times, where we assume the role of a character inserted into Age 440 - when even characters like Roshi and Shen were foolish youths.>How does this work?It's a relatively simple system. We roll a pool of d10s equal to the relevant stats, with the goal being to roll as high as possible on the dice. Each anon rolls a SINGLE d10 with their roll, after I call out what it's going to be ""best of"". For example, if your relevant stat is 3, it's ""Bo3"", and three anons roll 1d10.Eventually, as you grow stronger in different ways, the dice too will grow. You will never have more than Bo5, but the dice you roll may evolve into a d20, a d50, a d100...you get the idea.Rolling the minimum result on these dice is always going to be a critical failure, and rolling the highest result is always going to be a critical success, which also scale in how drastic they are with the size of the dice - a 1 on a d10 isn't going to be nearly as bad as a 1 on a d100, so don't worry too much about it.>Who are we playing?Wyald Honta, an almost-twelve-year-old hybrid of Human and Tiger-beastman who set out to explore the world in order to sate the call of his blood. Because of his hybrid nature, he ages quicker than humans, yet slower than other beastmen. He has a strong moral compass, a polite and friendly demeanour, but an unforgiving side when it comes to those who commit evil. He's slowly evolving the Way of the Warrior with his three friends: Azalea, Barbar, and Harum.>Last time on Dragon Ball: LegacyYou fought and then trained under Mutaito to learn the secrets of Ki, befriended Roshi and Shen, started a long-distance relationship with Love Teal, desperately trained to withstand the elements in Yunzabit Heights where you discovered a spaceship, became Korin's best student, got sidetracked on your way to Baba's by a league of Pirates that you almost completely dismantled, and bested most of Baba's fighters thus far after being enticed by the idea of battling otherworldly fighters!Comment too long.

21,"The two of you stare each other down as it becomes clear that you won't be responding to his vague threats, Spike's grin turning into a tight frown from the lack of reaction. As soon as baba calls out the start of the battle, you tense every muscle in your body and burst forward into a sprint that cracks the tiles beneath your feet, zigzagging on your approach with your limbs tucked in closely as you always do when adopting the River Stance. Most people would have a great deal of trouble tracking you like this, but you notice Spike's eyes keeping locked squarely on you on your approach, and his own muscles flex in preparation for an intercepting blow.Unfortunately for him, you know exactly where he thinks you're going to be thanks to your own 'predictable' approach, and right when he swipes out with a chop that would have caught you right in the neck you kick off an air-step to juke off to the side and duck low. Popping off of a second air step to gain forward momentum again, you slam your fist straight into his gut with a full force uppercut, knocking the air out of your opponent and flinging him into the air like a ragdoll. He suddenly suspends his motion after a few seconds, thrusting his hands and legs out with a burst of energy, and stares down at you hatefully.""A lucky shot, brat! We'll see how- WAIT, WAIT, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKING-"" He starts to say, growing suddenly panicked when he notices the fact that you're actually leaping up towards him by springing off of several air-steps to follow up on your first strike. Before he can really prepare much of a resistance, you're up in his face and swinging your body sideways so that you can put your all into a kick that catches the back of his neck and sends him hurtling back down towards the arena. With gravity assisting your effort, he embeds a good foot into the brickwork as soon as he impacts the ground, leaving you free to control your own descent to land with considerably more grace near his hole.With a growl of anger, he pulls himself out of the stones and brushes off some of the pebbles clinging to his suit. It looks like he wants to monologue again, but the fact that you're already on the move to keep up the aggression seems to dissuade him from such - he instead starts to spark with electricity suddenly, as though he's getting ready to use a technique of his own. With a malicious grin, he thrusts his hands towards you to try to intercept you, only for you to duck down into an extremely low-down slide and leave the electrical orb to fly harmlessly overhead. While he tries to charge up a second blast to compensate, you surprise him with some lightning of your own you've been charging up on your fingers, thrusting to point your index and middle finger at him to unleash a shocking bolt right at him that lights him up brightly for a few moments.",https://boards.4channel.org/qst/
22,"To his credit, he's still not down from all the damage he's taken so far. While you're righting yourself after the slide, he not only manages to shake off the momentary stunning you gave him, but also seems to be charging up a a particularly vile feeling pink energy between his fingers, clearly seething with frustration at the moment that has him quite literally foaming at the mouth as he prepares this next attack. ""That's it! I hope you're prepared to die, because nobody uses Spike the Devil Man as a punching bag and lives!"" He shouts.""Wait a minute, you can't use that! I forbid it! It's going too far!"" Baba shouts out suddenly, from the sidelines. You get the feeling that whatever he's preparing, you should either make sure you can dodge it...or stop him from using it to begin with. And you have the perfect tool for that, gritting your teeth and tensing your muscles to make it seem like you're going to be intent on going with the first option. However...""This next attack will amplify even the slightest evil in your heart until it explodes! Get ready, this is my ultimate attack, THE DEVILMITE BE-"" He exclaims, starting the motion of thrusting his fingers towards you to try to release that energy...when a particularly powerful and well-charged bolt of lightning strikes him from the clouds, causing his own attack to implode before it can be released and sending him flying back from the accumulated energy. When he lands, it's with a telltale splash, meaning he's officially out of bounds...and meaning you've officially won, actually!Baba whispers something to Bandages and Fangs, who go over to collect their greatest fighter while Baba approaches you. You think you can actually see Bandages wrapping up the fuming devil, perhaps to stop him from doing anything further now that he lost. ""Well, I can't say I didn't see this coming. The only thing I didn't expect was the fact that you made me lose two fighters during this venture, so now I have to find replacements! Hmph.""

""O-Oh, and I'm sorry for taking all the fights! I just wanted to test my limits against all of them, you know?"" You admit, bowing your head to them. Barbar just gives you a smirk and shakes his head, while Azalea and Harum say something to each other that you don't quite catch about how it's not surprising.""Normally I would let you ask up to five things of me for completing my challenge...however, if we subtract one for the damages to my poor palace and another for the vacancies you opened in my team, then I'm afraid I can only afford to give you three fortunes. If you want my advice, make it a good one that'll help you become nice and rich - that way you can just pay the fee the normal way."" She continues, ignoring your apology entirely. Admittedly, that does have you thinking now...what SHOULD you ask for?>Ask where you can find that final pirate captain. You won't let any pirates roam free on your watch!>Ask for a plan to become the greatest possible martial artist. You've only followed gut instinct and rumors so far, who knows what kind of masters you could find with an oracle able to guide you?>Ask her how you could extend your lifespan, or possibly even become immortal.

27,"Succubus/Incubus GeneralDiscord Exodus Edition DISCLAIMER:Some have reported attracting the attention of these entities by simply reading about them. If you're a dabbler who just wants to see if it works or if your faith forbids copulating with demons, don't summon. If you're unprepared for a potentially lifelong relationship, or at the very least, a life-long open door connection with sexual spirits and the occult, avoid this topic entirely. If you have a loving relationship with your human spouse or partner and desire a sex spirit to spice things up, or if you want a human partner in the future take caution, as these entities can be jealous or decide an initially open relationship is no longer so (request an open relationship during the summoning ritual). These spirits can harm or kill you when sufficiently angered and not easily banished.Last thread: >>34346983Old threads: https://archive.4plebs.org/x/search/subject/%2Fsuccgen%2F/FAQ:>What are succubi?Female spirits of sexual desire, who often choose human mates.

22,"Some of the many guns from the old Doom movie adaption. I don't remember it being particularly good, but the first person shooter scene is kind of neat, and the guns look cool enough. I think a good adaption of Doom is doable, inherently you need to take some liberties and divert or invent some things, it's just that the two adaptions which exist mostly did that wrong.The assault rifles for the movie were largely built on H&K G36 rifles, with various sci-fi embellishments. Many of them feature what appear to be some sort of grenade launcher, one which is fed from a magazine even, but I don't recall if any of them were ever fired. If you look at one of them, it appears to have some sort of protective cage over the pistolgrip (almost like a basket hilted sword?), not sure there was any rationale there besides aesthetics. The rifle in the third row I think was barely used in the movie at all, it was left over or something and mainly stayed in the background, and you also have a subgun (built on a H&K MP5K).A lot of the shells for these have showed up on auction sites over the years, not so easy to get the actual blank converted assault rifles, the armorers probably still have those, but the outer shell parts and either demilled G36 rifles, or airsoft ones, with these parts fitted. Then you have some of the stunt castings, made from rubber and ""biscuit foam,"" with metal wire armatures to make them retain their shape, and painted on the outside to match the firing guns, so that you can do stunts with the weapons and not risk that someone gets impaled or breaks some bone. Or when they don't need to shoot or be close to the camera, so the actors can carry less heavy props.The stunt castings appear the most common (they're cheap and flimsy, so you make a bunch of them), the subgun here is one of those, but you can find examples of the others.

34,"You have never and will never ""make"" money.Fiat money cannot be created or transferred when you trade shares, sell something, or work for a wage. Only banks and the mint make fiat money; everyone else simply transfers it from existing capital. This says nothing about the value of work or exchange, but rather the actual fiat face value in numbers. So all the ""rich"" people, such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Warren Buffett, never made a single cent; they only ever had money transferred to them from the preexisting money pool. The money pool only has money put into it by the mint or a bank (an approved deposit-taking institution or similar), and the latter, the bank or lever, injects 90% of the money. Shares that are not realized represent a sort of quasi-money where they are swapped with other shares at a notional value, but that is a different question. Money is fiat and is made by fractional reserve banking through loans and deposited into an account. This then makes it a tax on everyone through inflation. Also, the only way to pay off a loan is for someone to take out a loan later on, and that loan money must flow to you to be able to pay off your loan, and so on. It's essentially a pyramid scheme of loans. This is not necessarily bad, as it brings capital and labor together, but when it becomes disconnected from underlying value and fiat has pure capital allocation against underlying value, then you see everything shortages, and things that can capture price inflation, such as houses, go up in price forever over the long term. At some inflection point, the everything shortage may see food stuffs and everything else go up much more quickly, as people sitting in offices sending paper around to each other have limited overall efficiency gains and do not actually grow food. That marginal gain exhausts at some point.",https://boards.4channel.org/vip/

John Horhn, D-Jackson. “Well, help and don’t hurt. If you want to help, sit down and communicate with us.”The vote, which fell mostly along party lines, was 34 to 15 after three hours of debate. Every Democrat representing the city of Jackson voted against it after underscoring several times that they and their House counterparts from Jackson have not been at the table for the legislative process.Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, who chairs the Judiciary A Committee and defended the legislation on the floor, called it the “Jackson bill” and said the committee’s goal of redoing the bill was to make the city safe. That echoes what bill author Rep. Trey Lamar, R-Senatobia, has said about HB 1020’s intent. “That’s all we’ve been trying to do,” Wiggins said. Senators drastically amended the original House bill, removing controversial House provisions including a proposed separate court system within the city, an expanded Capitol Complex Improvement District and permanent appointed judges. The amended bill that passed the Senate on Tuesday would approve five state-funded judges who would be appointed by the Supreme Court chief justice to serve until December 2025. The Senate bill would also give existing Capitol Police department jurisdiction throughout the entire city of Jackson, and it would provide funding for positions in the Hinds County court system including legal assistants.",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

The claim has been contradicted by Dominion Voting Systems, one of the companies suing Lindell, who alleges the CEO has used his claims of electoral fraud to boost sales.But while Lindell claims to be hemorrhaging cash, the company continues to liberally distribute discount codes for its sponsorship program. An investigation by the progressive watchdog Media Matters found that MyPillow was helping fund at least 17 QAnon-affiliated shows and personalities by offering them a cut of sales made through their sales code.These personalities include Sidney Powell, an attorney who, alongside Lindell, spread conspiracy theories regarding Dominion and Smartmatic voting systems, and has also been named as a defendant in the defamation suits brought by the company.https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mypillow-ceo-says-company-going-024330318.htmlGo woke, go bro- Oh...",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

In addition, police also found diapers and dolls around his apartment, including a child-sized doll in his bed.Sutherland is alleged to have told police that he had no children, and no nieces or nephews. While the computer was seized by police in June of 2022, the forensic processing of it wasn't finished until January.Montgomery County police arrested Sutherland on six misdemeanor counts of possession of child pornography in early February. Last week, a judge ordered that he remain held without bond.

The guilty verdict marks the end of Householder’s long political career in which he twice held the speaker’s gavel. He’ll be in the Ohio history books as the only speaker expelled from the Legislature and then convicted in a federal corruption case. Householder and Borges, who neither showed any emotion when the verdict was read aloud, face up to 20 years in prison. After a seven-week trial, jurors deliberated just nine hours over two days.The case made it to federal court because of its sweeping scope: $61 million in bribe money paid by FirstEnergy Corp. via dark money groups to help Householder seize political power and in turn pass and defend a $1.3 billion bailout law known as House Bill 6. “This isn’t typical political activity, and they know it,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Megan Painter said during closing statements at the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse in Cincinnati. “Mr. Householder abused that (public) trust and Mr. Borges helped him do it.” After the verdict, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Parker said that the case shows that even powerful state leaders will be held accountable. ""You cannot sell the public trust. It is not for sale.""""This is a big win for all Ohioans,"" Parker said. He declined to answer questions about whether there may be more indictments.Comment too long. Click here to view the full text.",https://boards.4channel.org/news/
27,"Borges, who had an ethics conviction expunged more than a decade ago, declined a chance to sign a guilty plea that could’ve given him no more than six months in prison. Borges said after the verdict that he did not regret that choice.""I don't believe I would have been telling the truth (by pleading),"" Borges said. Householder was never given such an offer. Prosecutors introduced nearly 900 exhibits into evidence and slogged through volumes of text messages, emails, bank records and more than demonstrated what the men knew and actions they took. Two key players, Former FirstEnergy Solutions lobbyist Juan Cespedes and Householder’s political adviser Jeff Longstreth, took plea deals and testified against them. A fifth defendant, lobbyist Neil Clark, died by suicide in March 2021 after his arrest. Prosecutors also played secretly recorded phone calls and meetings captured by the FBI. Clark came on their radar while investigating a separate corruption case. Later, undercover agents posing as real estate developers with an interest in sports betting hired Clark as their lobbyist. Clark led them to Householder. Investigators tapped Clark’s phone but did not do a wiretap on Householder or Borges’ phones. Another big break came when Tyler Fehrman called the FBI in 2019 to report that Borges offered him a bribe in exchange for insider intel on the referendum campaign. Fehrman, who considered Borges a friend and mentor, wore a wire in subsequent meetings with him. >Householder took the stand in his own defenseComment too long.

Borges, 50, of Bexley in Franklin County, opted against taking the stand and did not present any defense witnesses. Instead, his legal team tried to draw jurors’ attention to times when Borges’ name didn’t appear in meetings, documents or plans. But in the end, the jury decided it wasn’t enough for reasonable doubt. >What's next?U.S. District Court Judge Timothy S. Black will sentence Householder and Borges in the coming months. Householder promised to appeal his conviction. They were not taken into custody. Black allowed both men to remain out on bond.""This is just step one....Stay tuned,"" Householder told reporters after the verdict.

Trump siding with Russia or Fox News playing cover for Trump and censoring the interview to protect Trump?https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-edits-out-donald-trump-saying-he-mightve-let-russia-take-over-parts-of-ukraineDonald Trump has long insisted that the Ukraine war would have never happened if he were still president, going so far as to blame the “rigged election” on Russia’s unprovoked invasion while claiming he had the magic words to stop the fighting “immediately.”During a radio interview with Fox News host (and longtime confidant) Sean Hannity on Monday, the twice-impeached ex-president finally revealed how he personally would have prevented the war. According to Trump, all he needed to do was let Russia “take over” parts of Ukraine.Saying that Russia was going for the “whole enchilada” with Joe Biden as president, Trump added that Russia “took over nothing” while he was in the White House because Russian President Vladimir Putin “understood” that “he would have never done it.”The former president then added: “That’s without even negotiating a deal. I could have negotiated. At worst, I could’ve made a deal to take over something, there are certain areas that are Russian-speaking areas, frankly, but you could’ve worked a deal.”Later that evening, Hannity played excerpts of his “exclusive” interview with Trump on his primetime Fox News program, along with highlights of Trump’s bombastic speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Though Hannity aired the segment featuring the ex-president boasting that he could have stopped the war, he curiously omitted the portion where Trump revealed his plan.Instead, shortly after Trump says, “I could have negotiated,” the audio quickly skips about 30 seconds of speaking time before picking back up where the former president pivots to his complaint that “China no longer respects the United States.”",https://boards.4channel.org/news/

And how many youth change their appearances with hormones or surgery only to later change their minds and detransition?Here’s a look at some of the issues involved.>WHAT IS TRANSGENDER MEDICAL TREATMENT?Guidelines call for thorough psychological assessments to confirm gender dysphoria — distress over gender identity that doesn’t match a person’s assigned sex — before starting any treatment.That treatment typically begins with puberty-blocking medication to temporarily pause sexual development. The idea is to give youngsters time to mature enough mentally and emotionally to make informed decisions about whether to pursue permanent treatment. Puberty blockers may be used for years and can increase risks for bone density loss, but that reverses when the drugs are stopped.Sex hormones — estrogen or testosterone — are offered next. Dutch research suggests that most gender-questioning youth on puberty blockers eventually choose to use these medications, which can produce permanent physical changes. So does transgender surgery, including breast removal or augmentation, which sometimes is offered during the mid-teen years but more typically not until age 18 or later. Comment too long.

That includes not only three-fourths of Democrats but also more than a third of Republicans.Overall, 39% say instead that the word reflects what has become the GOP political definition, ""to be overly politically correct and police others' words."" That's the view of 56% of Republicans.The findings raise questions about whether Republican campaign promises to ban policies at schools and workplaces they denounce as ""woke"" could boost a contender in the party's primaries but put them at odds with broader public opinion in the general election.Independents, by 51%-45%, say ""woke"" means being aware of social injustice, not being overly politically correct.“Most Americans understand that to be woke is to be tuned in to injustices around us,” said Cliff Young of Ipsos.

Primitively canned and jarred food that would leach metals or simply spoil. Plus refrigeration was yet to take off, so everything had to be kept cold on ice, making it significantly more expensive. All your standard vegetables and fruits were less available, and excluding the tomato, of lower quality. Apples back then were prone to russetting, stored poorly, and simply didnt taste as good. Sweet corn didnt even exist. On top of that, there was a health fad that really took root in Anglo and American culture at the time. Many people believed that heavily seasoned food was bad for you, and that the more something was cooked the healthier it was. The whole meme of white people not seasoning their food originates from that, and its why you see elderly people today refuse to season anything, and cook their mear until its leather.Yes, someone who literally lived on a farm and grew their own food might have a good diet relative to today, but the urban poor certainly didn't.",https://boards.4channel.org/ck/

Your lino plate is going to break down after a year and you can realistically only do a few dozen prints before it starts breaking down anyway. I work much more with intaglio so I only have a handful of relief plates under my belt. I find the softness of lino really off putting and prefer the look of woodcuts and wood engravings.,https://boards.4chan.org/ic/

69,">>6570173>>6572200Here's another example, an icon of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki portrayed as a warrior. Byzantine, c. 1400. Museum of Applied Art, Belgrade, Serbia.According to Piotr L. Grotowski, author of ""Arms and Armour of the Warrior Saints: Tradition and Innovation in Byzantine Iconography (843-1261)"" (2010), to tuck the mace in one's belt was the ""Byzantine custom"" (p. 369).In the case of Georgian warriors, Mamuka Tsurtsumia, in his article ""The Mace in Medieval Georgia"", published in ""Acta Militaria Mediaevalia XIV"" (2018), states the following:>Most frequently, the Georgians would wear the mace ""inserted"" in the belt worn round their waists which is clearly attested in sources and artistic images. ""Amirandarejaniani"" informs us that the maces were put in the belt (Mose Khoneli 1967, 737); He attached the mace close to his waist (ibid., 774). In addition, ""Rusudaniani"" also mentions: The mace was put in the belt (Rusudaniani 1957, 56); The mace was worn close to the waist (ibid., 284); He put the mace through his belt (ibid., 286); He put the mace into his belt (ibid., 427). The same holds true for ""Shahnavaziani"": The mace is put through his belt (Peshangi 1935, 182) and ""Omainiani"": He took out the 12-flanged mace from the belt (Kaikhosro Cholokashvili 1979, 167).Here's a link to the full article: http://amm.sanok.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/04_Tsurtsumia_AMM_XIV.pdf",https://boards.4chan.org/ic/

71,">>6572219That's nice to know. I have actually been meaning for a while to post some images depicting outfits that I personally consider to be suitably wizardly, but I refrained from doing so because it was arguable whether the people wearing them could be deemed as magic-practitioners (in the strict sense of the term). Thus, a bit of flexibility in the request is appreciated.Pic related is ""Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus, Contemporary of Moses"" (ca. 1488), an inlaid marble pavement mosaic by Giovanni di Stefano. Siena Cathedral, Siena, Tuscany, Italy.Regarding Hermes Trismegistus, here is some info from the Wikipedia article on him:>Hermes Trismegistus (from Ancient Greek: Ἑρμῆς ὁ Τρισμέγιστος, ""Hermes the Thrice-Greatest""; Classical Latin: Mercurius ter Maximus) is a legendary Hellenistic figure that originated as a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth. He is the purported author of the Hermetica, a widely diverse series of ancient and medieval pseudepigraphical texts that lay the basis of various philosophical systems known as Hermeticism. [...]>During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance the Hermetica enjoyed great prestige and were popular among alchemists. Hermes was also strongly associated with astrology, for example by the influential Islamic astrologer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi (787–886). The ""Hermetic tradition"" consequently refers to alchemy, magic, astrology, and related subjects. The texts are usually divided into two categories: the philosophical and the technical hermetica. The former deals mainly with philosophy, and the latter with practical magic, potions, and alchemy.",https://boards.4chan.org/ic/

Is to say that people are ""a product of their times"" not a hypocritical way to take from a philosopher what one agrees with and dismiss what one disagrees as a delusion of the philosopher? Like for example when marxists argue that the well documented racism and sexism of Marx was just a product of his times but Marxism is an eternal truth.Now to Plato. I have heard that he opposed democracy, thought women are inferior to men, condemned homosexuality and advocated for eugenics. Is this true?",https://boards.4channel.org/lit/

Of course it's a difficulty to apply their thought through the changes in economy, technology and media but they both made a point of a certain amount of freedom from (menial) work being necessary to citizenship and the practice of the latter not consisting merely of voting.

Now large organizations are able to control almost every institution on earth to manufacture either a consensus opinion, or the perception of a consensus, in this way an entirely legitimate democracy can be effectively controlled by a few billionaires.",https://boards.4channel.org/lit/

Two years ago, Wanting to improve my Italian, i signed up for a language exchange app. I could already read well enough but had no pronunciation, and still have a hard time following conversations. (they just speak too fast) I got matched up with this girl and we agreed for me to teach her Russian in return. We were friendly enough that this summer im going to visit her for the first time. Dont imagine any kind of whirlwind romance but we get along well and i really want to impress her. I know everything about Russian literature, history and music. That shit was sometimes literally beaten into me by my parents, but despite reading a few history and art history books, Italian culture is foreign to me.I've read most the pic bellow as well as various popular literature but it all feels like entry level stuff. He mom is a big name academic, her dad is a first violin. She is, and may Lenin forgive me for my transgression, an over educated member of the bourgeoisie. She loves Arbasino, and brightened up when i mentioned reading Fratelli d'Italia. She also talked about Gadda, though i cant make heads or tails of the man. But thats it.

Same with Terre D' Hermes, always somewhat different and i can never smell it that strong, straight from the bottle smells like a skin scent to me, guess i am a noselet for Iso E Super YET i supposedly have a bottle that uses that a whole lot and it smells like pure pencil but creamy.But i know very little of niche frags because i can buy a closet bottle with the money rather than a 5ml sample. Closet is what i refer to very popular frags that aren't on retail/physical stores for some obscure reason, most of the time classics like Drakkar Noir, Grey Flannel, Quorum, Pino Silvestre, Bogart and Lagerfeld stuff, they are hidden in storage in some weirdo stores and online salesmen.

42,">>940771>>940772I don't get your diagram. Where are the bones? What's moving?>>939852That's nice for the rotations you gave it. However, the arm and shoulder have much higher mobility range. The arms has to be capable of reaching down behind the back, and the rotating all way up and over behind the head. Which is a rotation of more than 180 degree. Possibly around 210. Granted, at the extreme extension, even the human body would appear stretched. But still, it has to rotate pretty far before losing volume or extreme clipping.Then add to, the shoulder joint has to be capable of twisting roughly 90 degrees. >>939858 (Cross-thread)Bendy Bones have a better time of creating smooth shoulder rotations. I've done a number of tests myself in that regard. The version I posted is like version 10 of bendy experiments. However, one bendy bone going through the shoulder and arm, creates something of noodle arm effect. The arm pit curves in an unconvincing way when the arm is down, and the bulk of the shoulder bends inward when the arms is up.I don't know. I think we both agree that weights are fundamentally flawed. But where we differ, is that I think whether or not you use automatic weights or fix the weights manually, it doesn't solve the fundamental problem.

20,"Long ago, on a planet called Earth, the greatest martial artist of his time made the ultimate sacrifice to seal away the most fearsome tyrant the world had ever seen. Master Mutaito gave his life to put an end to the threat that the Demon King Piccolo posed to the world. Our story, however, begins before even that...>What is this?This is a story following the adventures of a youth on Earth from pre-dragonball times, where we assume the role of a character inserted into Age 440 - when even characters like Roshi and Shen were foolish youths.>How does this work?It's a relatively simple system. We roll a pool of d10s equal to the relevant stats, with the goal being to roll as high as possible on the dice. Each anon rolls a SINGLE d10 with their roll, after I call out what it's going to be ""best of"". For example, if your relevant stat is 3, it's ""Bo3"", and three anons roll 1d10.Eventually, as you grow stronger in different ways, the dice too will grow. You will never have more than Bo5, but the dice you roll may evolve into a d20, a d50, a d100...you get the idea.Rolling the minimum result on these dice is always going to be a critical failure, and rolling the highest result is always going to be a critical success, which also scale in how drastic they are with the size of the dice - a 1 on a d10 isn't going to be nearly as bad as a 1 on a d100, so don't worry too much about it.>Who are we playing?Wyald Honta, an almost-twelve-year-old hybrid of Human and Tiger-beastman who set out to explore the world in order to sate the call of his blood. Because of his hybrid nature, he ages quicker than humans, yet slower than other beastmen. He has a strong moral compass, a polite and friendly demeanour, but an unforgiving side when it comes to those who commit evil. He's slowly evolving the Way of the Warrior with his three friends: Azalea, Barbar, and Harum.>Last time on Dragon Ball: LegacyYou fought and then trained under Mutaito to learn the secrets of Ki, befriended Roshi and Shen, started a long-distance relationship with Love Teal, desperately trained to withstand the elements in Yunzabit Heights where you discovered a spaceship, became Korin's best student, got sidetracked on your way to Baba's by a league of Pirates that you almost completely dismantled, and bested most of Baba's fighters thus far after being enticed by the idea of battling otherworldly fighters!Comment too long.

21,"The two of you stare each other down as it becomes clear that you won't be responding to his vague threats, Spike's grin turning into a tight frown from the lack of reaction. As soon as baba calls out the start of the battle, you tense every muscle in your body and burst forward into a sprint that cracks the tiles beneath your feet, zigzagging on your approach with your limbs tucked in closely as you always do when adopting the River Stance. Most people would have a great deal of trouble tracking you like this, but you notice Spike's eyes keeping locked squarely on you on your approach, and his own muscles flex in preparation for an intercepting blow.Unfortunately for him, you know exactly where he thinks you're going to be thanks to your own 'predictable' approach, and right when he swipes out with a chop that would have caught you right in the neck you kick off an air-step to juke off to the side and duck low. Popping off of a second air step to gain forward momentum again, you slam your fist straight into his gut with a full force uppercut, knocking the air out of your opponent and flinging him into the air like a ragdoll. He suddenly suspends his motion after a few seconds, thrusting his hands and legs out with a burst of energy, and stares down at you hatefully.""A lucky shot, brat! We'll see how- WAIT, WAIT, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKING-"" He starts to say, growing suddenly panicked when he notices the fact that you're actually leaping up towards him by springing off of several air-steps to follow up on your first strike. Before he can really prepare much of a resistance, you're up in his face and swinging your body sideways so that you can put your all into a kick that catches the back of his neck and sends him hurtling back down towards the arena. With gravity assisting your effort, he embeds a good foot into the brickwork as soon as he impacts the ground, leaving you free to control your own descent to land with considerably more grace near his hole.With a growl of anger, he pulls himself out of the stones and brushes off some of the pebbles clinging to his suit. It looks like he wants to monologue again, but the fact that you're already on the move to keep up the aggression seems to dissuade him from such - he instead starts to spark with electricity suddenly, as though he's getting ready to use a technique of his own. With a malicious grin, he thrusts his hands towards you to try to intercept you, only for you to duck down into an extremely low-down slide and leave the electrical orb to fly harmlessly overhead. While he tries to charge up a second blast to compensate, you surprise him with some lightning of your own you've been charging up on your fingers, thrusting to point your index and middle finger at him to unleash a shocking bolt right at him that lights him up brightly for a few moments.",https://boards.4channel.org/qst/
22,"To his credit, he's still not down from all the damage he's taken so far. While you're righting yourself after the slide, he not only manages to shake off the momentary stunning you gave him, but also seems to be charging up a a particularly vile feeling pink energy between his fingers, clearly seething with frustration at the moment that has him quite literally foaming at the mouth as he prepares this next attack. ""That's it! I hope you're prepared to die, because nobody uses Spike the Devil Man as a punching bag and lives!"" He shouts.""Wait a minute, you can't use that! I forbid it! It's going too far!"" Baba shouts out suddenly, from the sidelines. You get the feeling that whatever he's preparing, you should either make sure you can dodge it...or stop him from using it to begin with. And you have the perfect tool for that, gritting your teeth and tensing your muscles to make it seem like you're going to be intent on going with the first option. However...""This next attack will amplify even the slightest evil in your heart until it explodes! Get ready, this is my ultimate attack, THE DEVILMITE BE-"" He exclaims, starting the motion of thrusting his fingers towards you to try to release that energy...when a particularly powerful and well-charged bolt of lightning strikes him from the clouds, causing his own attack to implode before it can be released and sending him flying back from the accumulated energy. When he lands, it's with a telltale splash, meaning he's officially out of bounds...and meaning you've officially won, actually!Baba whispers something to Bandages and Fangs, who go over to collect their greatest fighter while Baba approaches you. You think you can actually see Bandages wrapping up the fuming devil, perhaps to stop him from doing anything further now that he lost. ""Well, I can't say I didn't see this coming. The only thing I didn't expect was the fact that you made me lose two fighters during this venture, so now I have to find replacements! Hmph."" Baba complains to you, carefully slipping off of her floating crystal ball to stand on her own for a bit.",https://boards.4channel.org/qst/
23,"""Sorry about that!"" You apologize bashfully, rubbing the back of your head. You glance to the rest of your friends for a moment, realizing something else. ""O-Oh, and I'm sorry for taking all the fights! I just wanted to test my limits against all of them, you know?"" You admit, bowing your head to them. Barbar just gives you a smirk and shakes his head, while Azalea and Harum say something to each other that you don't quite catch about how it's not surprising.""Normally I would let you ask up to five things of me for completing my challenge...however, if we subtract one for the damages to my poor palace and another for the vacancies you opened in my team, then I'm afraid I can only afford to give you three fortunes. If you want my advice, make it a good one that'll help you become nice and rich - that way you can just pay the fee the normal way."" She continues, ignoring your apology entirely. Admittedly, that does have you thinking now...what SHOULD you ask for?>Ask where you can find that final pirate captain. You won't let any pirates roam free on your watch!>Ask for a plan to become the greatest possible martial artist. You've only followed gut instinct and rumors so far, who knows what kind of masters you could find with an oracle able to guide you?>Ask her how you could extend your lifespan, or possibly even become immortal. You don't like to think about it much, but it's true that you're probably going to die sooner than other humans with how quickly you age.>Ask her how to acquire great wealth, her suggestion is honestly pretty sound!>Ask her where to find powerful treasures of the magical variety.

How about a meeting with the mayor? Maybe you'd like an appointment, hm?"">What do you say or do?",https://boards.4channel.org/qst/
74,"You had nothing else to tell her that you reckoned she wouldn’t ignore; you ruled it was better to keep moving ahead. Perhaps, though unlikely, her hopes would ring true, and she would find her brother an unchanged man. Else, the devil would get his dues. You glanced at her with brief pity and then moved ahead, your soles drifting through the sand and leaving your imprint on the Graveyard Frontier. With a seething expression, Goldie looked as you ignored the watch hand guiding towards Henry and instead trudged to where you deemed right to go. You were not going to be led by a child, neither were you going to walk to your death … even though Bill said the El Dorado Warren was not a nice place either.Another couple of hours passed in trudging silence, the soreness of prick marks boohooing in mild annoyance. The bullet wound crackled in your luminous flesh as if it was a sunken knife that chipped and then shattered into dozen shards while still inside your shoulder. You grasped your joint but it did little to veil the pain. The only thing keeping your attention from the wound was your thirst: what meagre drops of cactus juice you had in your body were becoming a memory. If Prickly Nicety’s nectar was a drink of choice in the Graveyard Frontier, then you hoped you would chance upon it again, even if it was going to dress in the flesh clothing of someone you knew. It wouldn’t be another Mercedes. Would it? You knew other people the welcoming and kind presence who could try and challenge your reason besides her, true?As you recollected their names and visages of them, you heard the sound of creaking metal and then, once you focused your gaze, a dazzling spectral monument in the shape of a windmill—no, a windpump. Standing there was a tower of abandoned opaque lumber that was curved and shifting like mist, similar to the ranch you saw not so long ago. Its eerie glow shifted from pale blue to intense green and cast a dim light which battled but soon faded into the fog. The many unmoving blades flashed under the moonlight, scintillating rust gnawing on the outlines. The rotor ground and groaned, but barely moved an inch. You neared underneath the phantom construction towards the empty pipe, as dry as your throat. You swallowed and scratched your head, was this some sort of joke on the behalf of the underworld?",https://boards.4channel.org/qst/
